# RX8OwnersClub.co.uk Prosilver based skin

This is the skin we use at http://www.rx8ownersclub.co.uk/forum - it tracks the prosilver version that phpBB issue in
their releases but with our tweaks.

Feel free to play with it but it's probably only of interest to forum admins, or enthusiastic forum members who want
to propose some changes.  And if you don't have an RX8, don't worry - you can still buy one.
